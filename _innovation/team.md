## New Website

Starting in the 2020 Fiscal year (July 2019 through June 2020), the Office of Civic Innovation merged with the Department of Information Technology (previously DoIT) to become the new Office of Civic Innovation and Technology (CIT).

See our new website here:

The new alignment created by CIT allows Metro to spread the use of innovative technology into our core enterprise services and staff, puts Open Data into one department, and allows more nimble management of Innovation technical projects around data automation, application development, data warehousing, and data movement, while aligning policy around and data access, privacy, and security.
