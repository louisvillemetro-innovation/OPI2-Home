Louisville's [Data Officer](/innovation/data-officer/) in the Office of Civic Innovation and Technology runs our city's [open data website](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/), which is government transparency and accountability in action.  Each department has a [Data Governance](/innovation/data-governance/) representative that is responsible for managing their open data publishing.

Open data, public transparency, and data-driven efforts in Louisville remain a strong and continuing priority for Mayor Greg
Fischer and the Office of Civic Innovation.  The Data Governance team works to release new data the public values, improve existing data sets, provide accurate metadata, and increase the frequency of data updates and automation.

## Datasets and Gallery

Louisville Metro [publishes over 200 datasets](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/) including budget items, crime reports, restaurant health ratings, employee salaries, building permits, car collisions, fire runs, and 311 service calls.  This information is used by companies like Waze, Yelp, the American Printing House for the Blind, Google Maps, Crime Reports, and Apple to improve your experiences within their apps and services that you use daily.   It's also is used by journalists, researchers, non-profits, and residents to help you understand what is happening across all levels of your city and neighborhood.

## Cost Savings

Open data reduces the quantity of and time it takes to fulfill open records requests, has invigorated innovation, economic growth and job creation, reduces duplicative efforts across departments, fascilitates data sharing both internally and externally, and improved the efficiency and effectiveness of government services.  The site is run using [free open source software](https://getdkan.org/).

## Civic Tech

The Civic Innovation office cultivates the relationship with our passionate volunteer groups helping to make us more efficient and push the limits of what city government can do for residents. Louisville has a robust volunteer civic technology ecosystem that [originated back in 2006](http://bit.ly/CivicDataHistory), with some volunteers now working within city government.  

[Code for Kentuckiana](https://codeforkentuckiana.org/) is the Louisville chapter of the national [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) non-profit. Currently, there are 70+ Brigades across the United States, bringing together community organizers, developers, and designers to use technology to improve the lives of citizens.  Code for Kentuckiana's mission is to organize and advocate for the use of public data and technology to make Louisville and Southern Indiana a more safe, resilient, and equitable place.

Together the city co-hosts hackathons and builds projects that can benefit residents, like a real-time bus tracker, resident feedback on the Dixie Highway project, voter turnout, car collision analysis, crime report findings, services for youth, and the internet speed test application [Speed Up Louisville](https://medium.com/louisville-metro-opi2/the-pathway-forward-for-mapping-broadband-speeds-in-america-da7df35320c2).
