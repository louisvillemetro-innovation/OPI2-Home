Louisville's first Data Officer [Michael Schnuerle](https://twitter.com/LouDataOfficer) runs the city's [open data](/innovation/open-data/) website, [data governance team](/innovation/data-governance/), data analytics projects, data warehousing, external partnerships, and automation across the city. 

While private companies have had Chief Data Officers for years to save money, create efficiencies, automate processes, and use data to make informed decisions, they are relatively new in government.  Louisville became the 12th US city to hire a Data Officer in 2016, and by 2019 there are 25 at the city/county level, 17 at the state level including Kentucky, and over a dozen at federal agencies.  

## Open Data

The Data Officer is responsible for the city's [Open Data website](/innovation/open-data/), including public feedback, data quality, proactive publishing of data, automation, working with department data experts, policy revisions, annual reports, updates, and data privacy.

## Data Governance

The Data Officer runs the city's internal [Data Governance team](/innovation/data-governance/) which includes 60+ Metro employees that work with data and represent every city department and has built a data-driven culture across the city, breaking down silos and fostering collaboration.

## Automation and Improvement

The Data Officer is creating the city's first data warehouse and automation system to allow departments to see each other's data for the first time, save time by improving the flow of data across systems and to the public, and create tools for departments, city leaders, and the public to make informed decisions about funding, prioritization, and optimization of data-driven projects and decisions.
