![Mobility is transforming](/assets/img/projects/smart-mobility/smart-mobility.jpg)

The transportation sector is in a period of transformation. Technology and data are changing the way that people and goods are moving in our community, and we expect this transformation to continue for decades. To help our organization embrace these changes and create the greatest benefit from them, we work with transportation organizations in Louisville Metro Government and our community to help them make plans for emerging technologies, build data tools for their daily work and continuous improvement, and build their workforce for these disruptive innovations.

## Mobility Projects

### Autonomous Vehicle Readiness 

Based on the level of testing underway and a raft of announcements from car makers and mobility providers, the commercial availability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) seems imminent. While projections of how, and how quickly, the technology will be adopted are still being debated, the potential for AVs to have a dramatic impact on how people and goods move to, from, and around makes for a compelling case to begin research and work toward the adoption of a policy framework that prepares for this technological shift while ensuring that mobility is enhanced in an equitable manner for all of Louisville’s residents.

### Mobility Innovation Team

Few things fundamentally affect the nature, feel, and operation of a city like its transportation system. Decisions about it affect nearly every facet of the community, and so, it is crucial to Louisville’s future that as major changes emerge, Metro will stand ready to make the most informed decisions possible. The MIT is a cross-organizational team that helps local organizations learn, prepare for, and implement innovative technologies and practices into our transportation network.

### Micromobility and Scooter Data Management

The Office of Civic Innovation's Data Officer manages the data policy and trip data coming from new moblity companies like Bird and Lime in order to ensure the companies' proper operation in our city and analyze the data for infrastructure improvements.  Our office applied for and were one of 5 cities accepted into [Stae's Civic Sandbox](https://medium.com/city-as-a-service/co-creating-with-cities-announcing-the-stae-civic-data-sandbox-b901d4f7c3bb) free program to build tools to help manage the public right of way and scooter fleets.  We are the first city to [publish scooter trip data online as open data](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/dockless-vehicles) for residents, the press, and researchers.

### Transportation Analysis Projects

We create tools and projects using crowdsourced and other data to evaluate traffic congestion problem areas and traffic improvement projects with the goal of empowering transportation professionals.

**[UPenn Traffic Safety Analysis](https://insiderlouisville.com/government/infrastructure/a-new-data-project-aims-to-predict-louisville-traffic-collisions/)** - 2018
* This free partnership used machine learning with local data to predict the cause and location of crashes to help inform our roadway safety work

**[UPenn Congestion Prediction](https://twitter.com/Md_Harris/status/1110714651833188353)** - 2019
* Using Waze data to predict congestion across a city an aligning the results to our [Waze WARP open source project](https://github.com/LouisvilleMetro/WazeCCPProcessor/wiki/Waze-CCP-Collaborative-Processor) for easy replication in other cities.  We are also doing a second project this year around fire risk predition for the Louisville Fire Department.

**Data Warehouse**
* We are developing a data warehouse for all Metro related transportation data with a focus on safety data, in collaboration with area and state transportation organizations.

### Waze Partnership

We publish online all of our city's [road closures and construction](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/lane-closures-construction) as open data so Waze can put that right into the Waze app 50,000 Louisvillians use each day to navigate our city more quickly and improve air quality.   Waze also freely gives Louisville valuable information on congestion and user-reported problems, which the Innovation office shares with departments to improve your commutes and fix issues.  Making sense of this firehose of data has cost other cities and states hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the Innovation office actually worked with corporations to pay a Louisville startup to [build these tools](https://github.com/LouisvilleMetro/WazeCCPProcessor/) for free, and we can now replace many $50,000 traffic studies instantly.

### Intelligent Transportation System Plan

Providing transportation infrastructure is one of the most important jobs of a local government. Over the past 100 years, Louisville Metro has built roads and transit systems to efficiently and effectively move people and goods. Providing this transportation infrastructure will continue to be a core responsibility of our government. This plans lays out necessary technology and data components of our transportation network are also built out and maintained because data and technology will power transportation in the near future.
