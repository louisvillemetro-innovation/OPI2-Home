![Mobility is transforming](/assets/img/projects/smart-mobility/smart-mobility.jpg)

The transportation sector is in a period of transformation. Technology and data are changing the way that people and goods are moving in our community, and we expect this transformation to continue for decades. To help our organization embrace these changes and create the greatest benefit from them, we work with transportation organizations in Louisville Metro Government and our community to help them make plans for emerging technologies, build data tools for their daily work and continuous improvement, and build their workforce for these disruptive innovations.

Some of our Smart Mobility Projects include:
* Autonomous Vehicle Playbook
* Waze Data Processing & Analysis
* Mobility Innovation Team

### Waze 

We publish online all of our city's road closures and construction so Waze can put that right into the Waze app 50,000 Louisvillians use each day to navigate our city more quickly and improve air quality.   Waze also freely gives Louisville valuable information on congestion and user-reported problems, which the Innovation office shares with departments to improve your commutes and fix issues.  Making sense of this firehose of data has cost other cities and states hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the Innovation office actually worked with corporations to pay a Louisville startup to build these tools, and we can now replace many $50,000 traffic studies instantly.
