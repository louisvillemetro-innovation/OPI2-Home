![Community hackathon](/assets/img/projects/community/community.jpg)

The Office of Performance Improvement & Innovation views hackathons as a key component of our strategy to not only institutionalize innovation, but to connect with our citizens, the tech community and any of our project stakeholders. It is a critical piece of collaborative strategy in the generation of civic engagement, relationship building and problem solving. We partner with our local Code for America chapter, Code for Kentuckiana, in addition to quarterly hackathons and public events that encapsulate our focus areas. This is in addition to nation-wide events, such as the National Civic Data of Hacking.
