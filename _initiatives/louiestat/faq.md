Q: How are targets determined for the KPIs?

Each KPI metric is assigned a goal. The performance of a department is measured against the goal. If a department meets or exceeds the goal, a green circle is displayed. A yellow triangle means a department is within 10% of reaching the goal. When a department is not within the 10% range of the goal, a red stop sign appears. A gray box means not enough information has been gathered either to determine a goal or measure performance against the goal.
