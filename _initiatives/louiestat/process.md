LouieStat launched in January 2012 with an ambitious goal of “on-boarding” nine departments within the first year. In 2013, LouieStat will add nine more departments. To get a department "on-board”, Office of Performance Improvement staff meet with the department’s Leadership Team regularly to understand what the department does and identify the most appropriate KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for what they do. To identify their KPIs, OPI helps departments answer two critical questions:

1. What results are we trying to achieve?
2. How would we know if we were achieving them?

Once identified, OPI works with departments to identify the areas in which they can improve current performance. Part of this process includes finding appropriate benchmarks for each KPI by identifying who is the best in the country.

In addition to the department specific KPIs that reflect the unique processes that most impact citizen satisfaction, there are four “enterprise” KPIs that OPI evaluates for every department in LouieStat:

- Unscheduled overtime
- Sick time usage
- Work related illness and injury
- Responsiveness to citizen concerns


### LouieStat Report

For each enterprise and department-level KPI, a KPI report is generated that displays:

- Data for the previous and current fiscal year
- The goal for that KPI
- Benchmarks internally and externally
- Overall performance

Performance is evaluated against the goal (i.e. Meets Goal, Approaching Goal, Off Goal). The KPI reports are presented in one document that is sent at least 48 hours before each LouieStat Forum to the Mayor, his senior leadership team and the department to provide time for attendees to review and develop questions prior to the Forum. This ensures all attendees are well prepared for the meeting and valuable time is used effectively.

LouieStat Forum

Once integrated into LouieStat, a department will meet with the Mayor and his senior leadership team, including heads of Communication, Finance, HR, Legal, Policy, and Technology every six to eight weeks to review the department’s performance, identify areas of weakness and discuss strategies and initiatives to improve. With all of the key decision makers in one room, any questions or potential barriers to success are discussed and removed before time and resources are expended on a potential initiative.

Through these recurring Forums, the Mayor and his senior leadership team are able to identify and spread best practices across departments, align Metro priorities, increase departmental accountability, and ultimately connect resources and actions to results.
