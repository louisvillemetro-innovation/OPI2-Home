Our Strategic Plan is a “living and breathing” document. Hence, it will continue to evolve with time; as goals are accomplished, new assignments are made and core missions are realigned to adapt to the changing needs of the city and its citizens. However, the plan will also evolve because of discoveries ---as we acquire a better understanding of our strengths and weaknesses; and yes, even as we learn from our mistakes.

This past year has brought about numerous and exciting changes for our collective enterprise; we have grown departmentally and matured as an organization. We have learned a great deal about ourselves, one another and most importantly about what our citizens expect from us. This learning process has been a challenging one, but one that all departments have gone through in their pursuit of excellence. The following progress report covers our strategic efforts from January 1, 2013 to November 30, 2013.
