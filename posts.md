This OPI2 Medium publication has been archived as of July 1, 2019.

The Improve and Innovate publication was created in March 2016 by the Office of Performance Improvement and Innovation (OPI2), part of Louisville Metro city government. Since that time we published 42 stories about our departmentâ€™s impact on our residents, which you can still view here.

In July 2019 the joint OPI2 office was split into OPI and CIT. See below for details with new Twitter and blog links.
