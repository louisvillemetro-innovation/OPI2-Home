lede_markdown: What results are we trying to achieve?
---

The Office of Performance Improvement is the business owner of a performance management program entitled, Louisville Statistics (abbreviated LouieStat). LouieStat brings individual Metro departments before the Mayor and his senior leadership team every six to eight weeks to identify and discuss, through consistent metrics tracking and data analysis, what the department (and Metro Government) can do to continually improve the services it delivers to the citizens of Louisville. In between LouieStat forums, OPI supports the department through management consulting, measurement identification, data analysis, performance reporting, training and coaching. OPI maintains the LouieStat [website](louiestat.louisvilleky.gov), which communicates each LouieStat department’s performance to the public.

The identification, tracking and analysis of the most important metrics for each department, called Key Performance Indicators or KPIs for short, helps Louisville Metro Government:

- Spot areas of weakness, where we are not delivering the best services or results possible
- Make data-driven decisions regarding where and how to best allocate resources
- Evaluate the true impact and effectiveness of the work being done across Metro Government

LouieStat has already made progress in helping save taxpayer dollars. Metro Corrections, for example, has been able to better manage overtime and in recent months has had lower overtime costs than any time during the last six years.

In the first year, nine departments were integrated into LouieStat — Parks, Public Works and Assets, Corrections, Fire, Animal Services, Codes and Regulations, Public Health and Wellness, Economic Growth & Innovation and EMS.

In the second year, nine additional departments will be added — Community Services & Revitalization, Library, Emergency Management Agency, Louisville Metro Police Department, Office of Management & Budget, Zoo, Human Resources, Metro Technology Services and Youth Detention Services.

LouieStat launched in January 2012 with an ambitious goal of “on-boarding” nine departments within the first year. In 2013, LouieStat will add nine more departments. To get a department "on-board”, Office of Performance Improvement staff meet with the department’s Leadership Team regularly to understand what the department does and identify the most appropriate KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for what they do. To identify their KPIs, OPI helps departments answer two critical questions:

1. What results are we trying to achieve?
2. How would we know if we were achieving them?

Once identified, OPI works with departments to identify the areas in which they can improve current performance. Part of this process includes finding appropriate benchmarks for each KPI by identifying who is the best in the country.

In addition to the department specific KPIs that reflect the unique processes that most impact citizen satisfaction, there are four “enterprise” KPIs that OPI evaluates for every department in LouieStat:

- Unscheduled overtime
- Sick time usage
- Work related illness and injury
- Responsiveness to citizen concerns

### LouieStat Report

For each enterprise and department-level KPI, a KPI report is generated that displays:

- Data for the previous and current fiscal year
- The goal for that KPI
- Benchmarks internally and externally
- Overall performance

Performance is evaluated against the goal (i.e. Meets Goal, Approaching Goal, Off Goal). The KPI reports are presented in one document that is sent at least 48 hours before each LouieStat Forum to the Mayor, his senior leadership team and the department to provide time for attendees to review and develop questions prior to the Forum. This ensures all attendees are well prepared for the meeting and valuable time is used effectively.

LouieStat Forum

Once integrated into LouieStat, a department will meet with the Mayor and his senior leadership team, including heads of Communication, Finance, HR, Legal, Policy, and Technology every six to eight weeks to review the department’s performance, identify areas of weakness and discuss strategies and initiatives to improve. With all of the key decision makers in one room, any questions or potential barriers to success are discussed and removed before time and resources are expended on a potential initiative.

Through these recurring Forums, the Mayor and his senior leadership team are able to identify and spread best practices across departments, align Metro priorities, increase departmental accountability, and ultimately connect resources and actions to results.

### FAQ

Q: How are targets determined for the KPIs?

Each KPI metric is assigned a goal. The performance of a department is measured against the goal. If a department meets or exceeds the goal, a green circle is displayed. A yellow triangle means a department is within 10% of reaching the goal. When a department is not within the 10% range of the goal, a red stop sign appears. A gray box means not enough information has been gathered either to determine a goal or measure performance against the goal.


Q: Which departments are involved in LouieStat?

In 2012, LouieStat on-boarded nine departments: Public Works & Assets, Louisville Fire Department, Metro Corrections, Metro Parks, Metro Animal Services, Codes & Regulations, Public Health & Wellness, Economic Growth & Innovation and Emergency Medical Services. In 2013, LouieStat will add nine additional departments including: Community Services & Revitalization, Library, Emergency Management Agency, Metro Police, Office of Management & Budget, Zoo, Human Resources, Metro Technology Services and Youth Detention Services.


Q: What is the methodology for selecting a department for LouieStat?

OPI follows a standard methodology of selection of departments for LouieStat. The methodology accounts for things like: number of employees, amount of appropriated funds, citizen impact, performance readiness and span of control.
Q: Why do some measures have goals set while others do not?


The first step in a department's LouieStat journey is to assess current performance. The second is to set goals for performance. Depending on where a particular department is on their LouieStat journey, they may or may not have selected goals yet. Any goals selected are SMART (Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely) goals.
